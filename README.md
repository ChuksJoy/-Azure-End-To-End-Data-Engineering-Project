# Azure-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

This is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics project where I built a complete pipeline to extract football data from **Wikipedia**, process it in **Azure**, and visualise insights using **Tableau**.

This project was inspired by and implemented while following this YouTube tutorial by Codewithyu, who is my mentor. You can find the video here ->

## Project Overview

In this project, I designed and implemented a modern data engineering workflow using industry-standard tools. The pipeline starts with data extraction and ends with interactive dashboards, simulating a real-world analytics use case.

### High-level Flow:
- Apache Airflow → Data Extraction  
- Azure Data Lake → Data Storage  
- Azure Data Factory → Data Migration & Transformation  
- Azure Synapse Analytics → Data Querying  
- Tableau → Data Visualization
